<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Glycosidases Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Endoglycosidase</li><li>Exoglycosidase</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The glycosidases market can be segmented into two main types: endoglycosidases and exoglycosidases. Endoglycosidases cleave glycosidic bonds within the polysaccharide chain, generating shorter oligosaccharides and aiding in carbohydrate remodeling. In contrast, exoglycosidases function by removing single sugar residues from the terminal ends of oligosaccharides, contributing to the final stages of carbohydrate degradation. Both types are essential for various applications, including biochemistry, pharmaceuticals, and biotechnology, enabling advancements in enzyme therapy and diagnostics.</p></p>
